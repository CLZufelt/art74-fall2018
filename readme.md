## :wavy_dash: About :wavy_dash:
The goal of this course is to establish a foundational digital literacy. Keep in mind that this class is an introduction on how to use hypermedia to make contemporary forms of art; it is not a software training course. The intention of this class is to use our modern age technology as environments rather than digital tools at our disposal. General understanding of the political, social, aesthetic implications of living in a digital age will be developed; in addition to experimenting with meta-mediums and ideas of how the logic of the art world and the logic of new media may be contrary.
